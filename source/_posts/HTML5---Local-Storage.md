## Better than cookies.
- The storage limit is larger.
- The information is never transferred to the server, advance website performance.
- Local storage is per origin (per domain and protocol).

## Check the browser support


## Two objects
### The localStorage Object
`window.localStorage` 
The localStorage object stores the data with **no** expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.


### The sessionStorage Object
The sessionStorage object is **equal** to the localStorage object, except that it stores the data for **only** **one** session. The data is deleted when the user closes the specific browser tab.
