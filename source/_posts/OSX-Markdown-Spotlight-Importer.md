# OSX Markdown Spotlight Importer

1. Downloaded this Zip file from [site](http://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/downloads/Markdown.mdimporter.zip) and uncompressed it

1. Moved the Markdown.mdimporter file to ~/Library/Spotlight. I had to create the folder under my Userâ€™s Library folder. To find this folder in Finder, hold the Option key when pressing the Go menu to see the Library folder option.
  ```
  mv ~/Download/Markdown.mdimporter ~/Library/Spotlight
  ```
1. Started a terminal shell
  ```JavaScript
  mdimport -r ~/Library/Spotlight/Markdown.mdimporter
  sudo mdutil -E /
  ```
1. Check if it work
  ```JavaScript
  mdimport -L
  ```
  To see if this is working, run
  ```JavaScript

      "/Library/Spotlight/iBooksAuthor.mdimporter",
      "/Library/Spotlight/iWork.mdimporter",
  ```
1. Test
  After a long while, all my Markdown files were once again searchable in Spotlight. Thanks Brett!
